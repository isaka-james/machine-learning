# Machine Learning in Rust

Welcome to the Machine Learning library implemented in Rust! This open-source library provides basic machine learning algorithms and utilities to facilitate the development of machine learning projects in Rust.

## Features

- **Linear Regression**: Perform linear regression analysis on your data.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for integrating into your projects.
- **Efficient**: Leverages Rust's performance and safety features.

## Installation

To use this library in your Rust project, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
machine_learning = "0.1.1"
```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to use this library and to stay updated with the latest algorithms and methods being added, please visit [documentation](https://isaka-james.github.io/ml-docs/).

## Future Updates

Currently, only the linear regression algorithm is published. We are actively working on adding more algorithms and methods. Regularly check the documentation to see what new features have been added.
